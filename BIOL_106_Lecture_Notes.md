# BIOL 106 Lecture Notes
## Lecture 1: How trees work
- Are taxa 2-3 an outgroup from 4-6?
- they're sisters
- **synapomorphy**: shared derived trait from something that already existed (mammals shared the synapomorphy hair)

1. f - only snakes have trait c
2. f - crocodiles only have trait a
3. t
4. f - dinosaurs only have trait a
5. t

- **clade**: everything associated with a node
- **monophyletic**: ALL descendants, evolutionary biology seeks to identify these clades
- **paraphyletic**: SOME descendants, some don't have the synapomorphy in question, there must be a mistake in classification but they let it go, or fix by adding the missing taxon

7. f

- clade names: terminal taxa or groups like tetrapoda, amniota

## Lecture 2

- all living organisms have cells
- prokaryotes are paraphyletic -- why?
    - bacteria and archaea are both unicellular, so why aren't they grouped together?
    - archaea and eukarya have everything else in common, which is why they're sister groups
    - eukarya are _mostly_ multicellular
- prokaryotes lack nuclear membrane
- uncertain whether archaea or bacteria evolved first
- most interesting thing to me about this slide: I noticed how life has seemed to evolve exponentially -- it took a long, long time for simple organisms (bacteria and archaea) to evolve into an ideal, robust scaffolding upon which eukaryotic organisms could form. Once there was a solid foundation, evolution appeared to really take off! 
- it's wise to take probiotic after taking antibiotic to replenish good bacteria that got killed
- **peptidoglycan**: unique to bacteria, in cell wall, how antibiotics work, interfere with synthesis of it, cell wall ruptures, bacteria don't survive, but they don't kill human cells!
