# BIOL 106 Lecture Notes
## Lecture 1: How trees work
- Are taxa 2-3 an outgroup from 4-6?
- they're sisters
- **synapomorphy**: shared derived trait from something that already existed (mammals shared the synapomorphy hair)

1. f - only snakes have trait c
2. f - crocodiles only have trait a
3. t
4. f - dinosaurs only have trait a
5. t

- **clade**: everything associated with a node
- **monophyletic**: ALL descendants, evolutionary biology seeks to identify these clades
- **paraphyletic**: SOME descendants, some don't have the synapomorphy in question, there must be a mistake in classification but they let it go, or fix by adding the missing taxon

1. t
2. t
3. t
4. t
5. t
6. t
7. f

- clade names: terminal taxa or groups like tetrapoda, amniota

## Lecture 2

- all living organisms have cells
- prokaryotes are paraphyletic -- why?
    - bacteria and archaea are both unicellular, so why aren't they grouped together?
    - archaea and eukarya have everything else in common, which is why they're sister groups
    - eukarya are _mostly_ multicellular
- prokaryotes lack nuclear membrane
- uncertain whether archaea or bacteria evolved first
- most interesting thing to me about this slide: I noticed how life has seemed to evolve exponentially -- it took a long, long time for simple organisms (bacteria and archaea) to evolve into an ideal, robust scaffolding upon which eukaryotic organisms could form. Once there was a solid foundation, evolution appeared to really take off! 
- it's wise to take probiotic after taking antibiotic to replenish good bacteria that got killed
- **peptidoglycan**: unique to bacteria, in cell wall, how antibiotics work, interfere with synthesis of it, cell wall ruptures, bacteria don't survive, but they don't kill human cells!

### quiz on friday, will open thursday morning

## Wednesday, September 6, 2023

- bacteria names = shape
    - spiral - spirilla
    - rod - bacilli
    - spherical - cocci
- mobility
    - flagella
- life originated 3.8 billion years ago
    - a few organic molecules
    - rna self-replicated
    - cell walls formed around genetic material
- bacteria tree 
    - learn it for friday's quiz
    - draw it yourself
- 5 lineages/taxa
- 2 synapomorphies
- groups
    - thermophiles
        - harsh environments
        - hot springs
        - extreme heat
        - origin of life? persisted in environments that no one else could
    - proteobacteria
        - you spend a lot of time on this if you're in medical school
        - E. coli, salmonella, vibrio, and another one
        - origin of mitochondrial dna
            - mtDNA
            - in every cell we have (eukaryotes)
        - biggest group of bacteria
        - H. pylori
            - stomach ulcers caused by stress? intense stomach pain - actually associated with this bacterium
        - vibrio
            - bioluminescent
            - can see from space
            - pathogenic - often causes infection if you cook undercooked seafood or swim in contaminated water
            - symbiotic relationship with squid - countershading counters its silhouette
        - salmonella
            - from eating uncooked poultry or fish
                - or typhoid fever
            - binary fission - they split themselves in two - no partner needed, don't reproduce sexually - can reproduce very quickly - daughter cells - can grow exponentially within an hour or two
    - cyanobacteria
        - performs photosynthesis
            - originated in bacteria
            - origin of chloroplast DNA in plants
        - pond scum, toxic to humans and other animals
            - several layers and species of cyano together
        - spirulina ("health food")
        - oxygen revolution
            - first 2.3 billion years - oxygen virtually non-existent
            - these guys produce oxygen
        - release nucleic acids into atmosphere in form of nitrogen - backbone of protein and DNA - ammonia
        - atmospheric oxygen level - once high enough, eukarya began to flourish
    - spirochetes
        - spiral shape
        - famous for syphilis
            - T. pallidum
        - Borrelia
            - Lyme disease
                - at least 15 million years old! older than humans
                - found in other animals, ticks
    - gram-positive
        - easier to treat with antibiotics
        - dye
        - staphyloccocus aureus
            - pimples, toxic shock syndrome, pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis
        - streptococcus
        - b. anthracis (anthrax)
- archaea
    - not bacteria
    - sister to eukarya

## Lecture 3

- Eukarya
- Eukaryotic cell
- has true nucleus
- endosymbiosis
- many multicellular
- six major lineages
- protists
- paraphyletic group
- any eukarya that is not a land plant, animal, or fungi
- not a synapomorphy
- nuclear dna and mitochondrial dna (circular genome)
- endosym
- 3 stories
- all euks in general, and two for plants
- archaeal cell engulfs bacterium, which survives and they both benefit (produces atp that cell can use)
- plants are eukarya, therefore they have mtDNA
- plants have three genomes
- photosynthetic protists (secondary endosymbiosis)
- engulfment of other protist plant groups like red algae
