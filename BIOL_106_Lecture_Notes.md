# BIOL 106 Lecture Notes
## Lecture 1: How trees work
- Are taxa 2-3 an outgroup from 4-6?
- they're sisters
- **synapomorphy**: shared derived trait from something that already existed (mammals shared the synapomorphy hair)

1. f - only snakes have trait c
2. f - crocodiles only have trait a
3. t
4. f - dinosaurs only have trait a
5. t

- **clade**: everything associated with a node
- **monophyletic**: ALL descendants, evolutionary biology seeks to identify these clades
- **paraphyletic**: SOME descendants, some don't have the synapomorphy in question, there must be a mistake in classification but they let it go, or fix by adding the missing taxon

1. t
2. t
3. t
4. t
5. t
6. t
7. f

- clade names: terminal taxa or groups like tetrapoda, amniota

## Lecture 2

- all living organisms have cells
- prokaryotes are paraphyletic -- why?
    - bacteria and archaea are both unicellular, so why aren't they grouped together?
    - archaea and eukarya have everything else in common, which is why they're sister groups
    - eukarya are _mostly_ multicellular
- prokaryotes lack nuclear membrane
- uncertain whether archaea or bacteria evolved first
- most interesting thing to me about this slide: I noticed how life has seemed to evolve exponentially -- it took a long, long time for simple organisms (bacteria and archaea) to evolve into an ideal, robust scaffolding upon which eukaryotic organisms could form. Once there was a solid foundation, evolution appeared to really take off! 
- it's wise to take probiotic after taking antibiotic to replenish good bacteria that got killed
- **peptidoglycan**: unique to bacteria, in cell wall, how antibiotics work, interfere with synthesis of it, cell wall ruptures, bacteria don't survive, but they don't kill human cells!

Lecture
- aquatic plants moved to land
- stoneworts
    - multicellular
    - aquatic
    - last aquatic plant
    - bottom of lakes

Tree
- red algae, green, stoneworts, all underwater
- then land plants: non-vascular land plants, seedless vascular, seeds

What's important for a land plant?
- survival in air
    - prevent water loss
        - cuticles are waxy and do this
            - succulents, leaves
            - a syn for LAND PLANTS
    - stomata
        - gas exchange
        - not in very first land plant (liverworts)
        - starts with mosses, non-vascular land plants
    - those were syns
- stay upright in air
    - vascular tissue
    - exception: liverworts, mosses, hornworts
        - small size
    - lignin - woody substance (tree bark, branches)
    - provides structure and support
    - vascular plants and seed plants
- reproduce in air
    - embryo retention
        - novel for plants
        - offspring used to float in the water and developed outside of the plant, got nutrients and such from water
        - embryo stays on plant and gets nutrients from it

- plant diversity
    - plants start as non-vascular, like mosses, small size
    - then, vascular but seedless
    - last, vascular and seeds

- non-vascular plants
    - liverworts
        - know where they are in the tree, and know they're non-vascular
    - mosses
        - peat moss for energy source

- seedless vascular plants
    - ferns

- how to study
    - make your own tree and label it
    - today's slides contain four practice trees
    - use them to figure out where you need to study more

## Lecture 5

- descent with modification
    - roots, shoots, leaves
- alternation of generations
    - protect gametes
    - uniting gametes
    - chromosomes in human genome
    - diploid cells (two copies of every chromosome except for sex chromosomes)
    - n = chromosomes
    - 2n => diploid
        - most of your cells are diploid
    - n => haploid
        - egg = 1n, sperm = 1n
        - zygote maximally can be 2n
    - mitosis
        - cell division that results in replication
        - every few minutes our cells are regenerating
    - meiosis
        - cell division that reduces number of chromosomes by half
        - one 2n -> one 4n -> two 2n -> four n
    - what if our eggs and sperm established themselves as their own organism? this is what plants do
- sporophyted dominated life cycle
- heterospory
